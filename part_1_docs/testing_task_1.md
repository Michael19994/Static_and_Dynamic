### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
# Line 29 'dif' should be 'def' and a coma is missing between card1 and card2 arguements
# Line 30-33 if statement should be indented to the block
# Line 31 is using 'card' rather than 'card1'
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  

# Line 38 'def' indendation should be under the class. 
# Line 39 'total' has not been defined
# Line 42 return statement should be out of the loop
def cards_total(self, cards):
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
